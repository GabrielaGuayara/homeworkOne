        <p>Hello everyone! My name is Gabriela Guayara. I am aspiring Software Engineer with passion for developing websites or app that make a positive impact.</p>
        
        <p>I graduated from Borough of Manhattan Community College last december 2023. When I was at college, I had the opportunity to work as an Academic Mentor for freshman students. I was able to help first-generation students to navigate BMCC and take advantage of the different resources it offers. I also worked as a group lider for the National Society of Leadership and Success.</p>

        <p>I like reading, watching movies, hanging out with friends and listening to music. A good book a recommend to read is "Girl in Translation". The book is about a Chinese girl who immigrates to the U.S. when she is 13. The book follows Kim's journey from going to school while working in a factory to a sucessful career as a surgeon. It's a moving story that motivates me to continue working hard until reaching my goals</p>
